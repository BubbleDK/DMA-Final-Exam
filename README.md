## Usage

This project has no actual use but lays the foundation for a proof of concept for an in-house Consent Management Platform. The project is able to scan a website for existing cookies.
Save those cookies to your chosen database (this project uses a relational SQL-database)

The project also consists of a UI for accepting TOC for cookies on a website: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7b8550c-7103-41a7-9393-cdcef2cb0399)

The project also contains a UI for system users to interact with different websites to see which cookies have been scanned and enabled/disabled for a site. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a5732e-7d2b-4247-9d55-29e2e6ac87e6)
