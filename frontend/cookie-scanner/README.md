# Cookie Scanner

This is a simple tool using puppeteer to scan cookies from a website; the output is a JSON file with the cookies and local storage (a bit buggy).

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
# To hit cookiescanner on express server:
# http://localhost:5000/api/cookies/https://example.com
# Browse in the browser that opens
# Close the browser
```
